# Technical Data Sheet - PETGAS 4K - 2R

## GENERAL INFORMATION

1. **Process**:
   - Plastic pyrolysis is performed in the absence of oxygen, preventing combustion and pollutant emissions.
   - The system converts plastics from solid to gaseous state, later condensed into fuels.

2. **Energy Self-Sufficiency**:
   - The obtained gas is recycled into the process, making the system self-sufficient.

3. **Reactor and Process Time**:
   - The reactor is fed with shredded plastic.
   - Hydrocarbons are obtained through pressure and temperature control in the distillation system.
   - Estimated time per cycle: **8-10 hours** (depending on size and location).

4. **Suitable Plastic Types**:
   - Ideal: HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS.
   - In controlled percentages: PET, PVC.

## BENEFITS

1. **Training**:
   - Strategic collection of plastic waste in the city where the plant is installed.
   - Equipment operation.
   - Corrective and preventive maintenance.

2. **Installation and Start-up**:
   - Includes installation and start-up of the plant (electrical material not included).

3. **Quality Management**:
   - Integrated system for production and quality control in hydrocarbon processing.
   - From plastic identification to transformation into alternative fuels.

4. **Industrial Safety**:
   - Safety training for operational personnel according to local regulations.

5. **Technical Support**:
   - Technical and strategic assistance from the specialized team.

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION
